# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## My Task

To create a simple calender allowing the user to type and save events for the hours of their work day. Using HTML and CSS with jQuery the user is able to know the time and day while showing a visual of the current time on the calender.

## Demonstration

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
